# start

**Start** is a framework tailored for building simple **2-dimensional games** and applications featuring **Graphical User Interfaces** (GUIs). Its straightforward design makes it an excellent choice for anyone looking to rapidly prototype or experiment with interactive 2D experiences.

While Start is primarily focused on 2D development, I am actively experimenting with *OpenGL* integration to expand its capabilities towards creating **3-dimensional applications** in the future. This makes *Start* a flexible playground not just for game developers, but also for those curious about graphics programming and custom application interfaces.

To discover more about what *Start* can do, feel free to visit my [page](https://paul-green-stone.github.io/paul-green-stone/).

## Dependencies

*Start* relies on several third-party libraries, so please ensure the following are installed on your machine before building or running the framework:

* [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/)
* [SDL2_Image](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image)
* [SDL2_ttf](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf)
* [libconfig](https://hyperrealm.github.io/libconfig/)

## Documentation

While there is no dedicated online documentation yet, the project includes numerous example programs with clear in-code comments (*I hope*) and explanations to help you get started.

## Contributing

I warmly welcome contributions from the community! Whether you want to report bugs, suggest features, improve the code, or add examples, your help is greatly appreciated.

If you’re interested in contributing to *Start*, please feel free to open issues or submit pull requests. Let’s build this project together and make it a great resource for everyone interested in 2D (and soon 3D) graphics programming!
